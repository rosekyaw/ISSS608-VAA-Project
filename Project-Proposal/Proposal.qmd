# Introduction

This project is to reveal and understand the spread and spatial patterns of functional and non-functional water in Nigeria. This is to reduce the trouble/difficulty of users (politicians, academics, local planners and local community) in visualising waterpoint patterns in Nigeria. This will make the data more accessible and easier to interpret.

The dataset used is from https://data.waterpointdata.org/dataset/Water-Point-Data-Exchange-Plus-WPdx-/eqje-vguj/data
