# User Guide

This Waterpoint app allow users to have an overview on the distribution of water points by operational status and attributes, analysed the water points visually and segment into various clusters to facilitate decision making in resources management for the water points.

There are 3 key features in this app, namely Overview, Visual Inferential Analytics and Geographical Segmentation.

# Overview

*Homepage \> [App](https://rkyaw.shinyapps.io/nigeria_waterpoint/)\> Overview*

The key functions for this tab is to facilitate users to visualise the distribution of water points at LDA2 level. These water points are those functional, non-functional as well as unknown.

![](images/image-1655219087.png)

Following are the key functions :

1.  Visualise the status of water points distribution. Their distribution is measured by the percentage of the selected status within a given district.

    There are 3 type of status available :

    -   Functional water points.

    -   Non-functional water points.

    -   Unknown water points.

2.  Visualise the attributes associated with the water points.

    There are

    -   Water source, refers to the 2 major type of water sources available for most of the water points in Nigeria. There are 2 options available :

        -   **Spring**

        -   **Well**

    -   **Technology**, refers to the deployed equipment to supply water resources to the surrounding communities. There are 2 options available :

        -   **Hand Pump**, shows the percentage of water points equipped with manual equipment.

        -   **Mechanised Pump**, shows the percentage of water points with equipment that operated with minimal human involvement.

    -   **Pressure Score**, measures the utilisation level of the water points. This is done by measures the ratio of the population within 1 km radius from the water points, and by the usage capacity limit thereof. There are 2 options available :

        -   **Low Pressure Score**, are the water points that are not over supporting population within 1 km radius.

        -   **High Pressure Score**, are the water points that have breached their usage capacity limit. Urgent attention and resources are required to upgrade or maintain the water points to sustain the community growth.

    -   **Crucial Score**, measures the crucial level of the water points for population within 1 km radius. There are 2 options available :

        -   **Low Crucial Score**, are the water points with score below 0.4, generally supporting less than half of the population within 1 km radius.

        -   **High Crucial Score**, are the water points with score above 0.4, may indicates they are supporting more than half population, with some of them supporting almost entire population.

    -   **Capacity**, refers to the limit of population a water points can support. Generally, these limits are categorised into 5 main category, namely 50, 250, 300, 500 and 1000. For this app, we group all the capacity categories below 1000 as 1 attribute to identify which area require more resources to maintain or upgrade.

        -   **Low Capacity**, include all the usage capacity limit below 1000.

        -   **High Capacity**, refers are the water points with usage capacity limit 1000.

    -   **Urban or Rural?,** a community parameter that indicates the percentage of water points fall within '**Urban**' or '**Rural**' community.

# Visual Inferential Analysis

*Homepage \>* [*App*](https://rkyaw.shinyapps.io/nigeria_waterpoint/) *\> Visual Inferential Analysis*

The key functions for this tab is to allow users to visually analyse variances (ANOVA) and correlation of various attributes across different states.

Following are the key functions :

![](images/image-431995626.png)

1.  **ANOVA**

    This tab allows users to visually analyse the variances by states based on the selected attribute.

    There are 19 attributes available :

    -   3 options of water points options to select from "**Total Waterpoints**", "**Functional waterpoints**" and "**Non-functional Water Points**"

    -   3 options of **Technology** parameter : "**Handpumps**", "**Mechanical Pumps**" and "**Tap Stands**".

    -   5 options of **Capacity** parameter : "**Usage Capacity 50**", "**Usage Capacity 250**", "**Usage Capacity 300**", "**Usage Capacity 1000**" and "**Usage Capacity below 1000**".

    -   2 options of **Community** parameter : "**Urban**" and "**Rural**" communities.

    -   2 options of **Crucial Score** parameter : "**Low Crucial Score**" and "**High Crucial Score**".

    -   4 options of **Pressure Score** parameter : "**Pressure Score below 0.9**", "**above 0.9 but below 1.9**", "**above 1.9, below 3.9**" and "**above 3.9**".

2.  **CORRELATION**

    ![](images/image-2120188057.png)

    This tab allows users to visually explore the correlation strength between two attributes by select the attribute for Variable 1 and Variable 2.

# Geographical Segmentation

*Homepage \>* [*App*](https://rkyaw.shinyapps.io/nigeria_waterpoint/) *\> Geographical Segmentation*

The key functions for this tab is to allow users to perform Hierarchical Clustering geospatial analysis based on 3 or more attributes.

Following are the key functions :

1.  **Clustering Map**

![](images/image-915361031.png)

2.  **Determine Optimal K value**

![](images/image-1575984388.png)

3.  **Visual Analytics with Heatmap**
