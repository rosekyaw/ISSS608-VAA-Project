This is to reduce the trouble/difficulty of users (politicians, academics, local planners and local community) in visualising waterpoint patterns in Nigeria. This will make the data more accessible and easier to interpret.\nThe dataset used is from https://data.waterpointdata.org/dataset/Water-Point-Data-Exchange-Plus-WPdx-/eqje-vguj/data\n\n\nRelated Relevant Work\n\n\nApproach\n\n\nPrototype Storyboard"
