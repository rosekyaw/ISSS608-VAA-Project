    "text": "In rural Africa, access to clean and safe water can be a challenge. Thousands of water points have been installed over the past decade but they are of poor quality or are not well maintained causing them to become non-functional. This can cause waterborne diseases which can destroy lives and livelihoods. One country in West Africa which faces this issue is Nigeria.\nAccording to a research paper1 which utilises information from the 2015 Nigeria National Water and Sanitation Survey, more than 38 percent of all improved water points in Nigeria are non-functional. Hence, it would be in the interest of the Nigerian government as well as non-governmental organizations and researchers to discover water points patterns in Nigeria and potentially figure out what is causing the problem and how to solve it."

It can display locations of functional, non-functional and unknown water points in terms of country-level or district-level throughout Nigeria. The intention is to help the users visualise which region in the country has higher functioning/non-functioning water points at a glance. There will be a few filtering options for the users, such as water points status, technology deployed in water points and performance of water points."

Graphs include correlation matrices, error bars, confidence strips, ridge plot and funnel plot.\nThis will help users identify relationships or correlations between different features, such as technology used or pressure score with number of non-functional water points through correlation matrices. It may also allow users to compare statistics across different districts through oneway ANOVA tests visualisations."

Hence, it would be in the interest of the Nigerian government as well as non-governmental organizations and researchers to discover water points patterns in Nigeria and potentially figure out what is causing the problem and how to solve it.\nThe scope of this project is to reveal and understand the spread and geospatial patterns of functional and non-functional waterpoints in Nigeria. This will help reduce the difficulty of users such as the government, local community planners and academic researchers in visualising waterpoint patterns in Nigeria. The aim is to make the data more accessible and easier to interpret by having interactive charts showing both high-level patterns and low-level details, such as water access by the district."
