    "text": "In rural Africa, access to clean and safe water can be a challenge. Thousands of water points have been installed over the past decade but they are of poor quality or are not well maintained causing them to become non-functional. This can cause waterborne diseases which can destroy lives and livelihoods. One country in West Africa which faces this issue is Nigeria.\nAccording to a research paper1 which utilises information from the 2015 Nigeria National Water and Sanitation Survey, more than 38 percent of all improved water points in Nigeria are non-functional. Hence, it would be in the interest of the Nigerian government as well as non-governmental organizations and researchers to discover water points patterns in Nigeria and potentially figure out what is causing the problem and how to solve it."

It can display locations of functional, non-functional and unknown water points in terms of country-level or district-level throughout Nigeria. The intention is to help the users visualise which region in the country has higher functioning/non-functioning water points at a glance. There will be a few filtering options for the users, such as water points status, technology deployed in water points and performance of water points."

This will help reduce the difficulty of users such as the government, local community planners and academic researchers in visualising waterpoint patterns in Nigeria. The aim is to make the data more accessible and easier to interpret by having interactive charts showing both high-level patterns and low-level details, such as water access by the district."

    "text": "User Guide\nThis Waterpoint app allow users to have an overview on the distribution of water points by operational status and attributes, analysed the water points visually and segment into various clusters to facilitate decision making in resources management for the water points.\nThere are 3 key features in this app, namely Overview, Visual Inferential Analytics and Geographical Segmentation.\n\n\nOverview\nHomepage > App> Overview\nThe key functions for this tab is to facilitate users to visualise the distribution of water points at LDA2 level. These water points are those functional, non-functional as well as unknown.\n\nFollowing are the key functions :\n\nVisualise the status of water points distribution. Their distribution is measured by the percentage of the selected status within a given district.\nThere are 3 type of status available :\n\nFunctional water points.\nNon-functional water points.\nUnknown water points.\n\nVisualise the attributes associated with the water points.\nThere are\n\nWater source, refers to the 2 major type of water sources available for most of the water points in Nigeria. There are 2 options available :\n\nSpring\nWell\n\nTechnology, refers to the deployed equipment to supply water resources to the surrounding communities. There are 2 options available :\n\nHand Pump, shows the percentage of water points equipped with manual equipment.\nMechanised Pump, shows the percentage of water points with equipment that operated with minimal human involvement.\n\nPressure Score, measures the utilisation level of the water points. This is done by measures the ratio of the population within 1 km radius from the water points, and by the usage capacity limit thereof. There are 2 options available :\n\nLow Pressure Score, are the water points that are not over supporting population within 1 km radius.\nHigh Pressure Score, are the water points that have breached their usage capacity limit. Urgent attention and resources are required to upgrade or maintain the water points to sustain the community growth.\n\nCrucial Score, measures the crucial level of the water points for population within 1 km radius. There are 2 options available :\n\nLow Crucial Score, are the water points with score below 0.4, generally supporting less than half of the population within 1 km radius.\nHigh Crucial Score, are the water points with score above 0.4, may indicates they are supporting more than half population, with some of them supporting almost entire population.\n\nCapacity, refers to the limit of population a water points can support. Generally, these limits are categorised into 5 main category, namely 50, 250, 300, 500 and 1000. For this app, we group all the capacity categories below 1000 as 1 attribute to identify which area require more resources to maintain or upgrade.\n\nLow Capacity, include all the usage capacity limit below 1000.\nHigh Capacity, refers are the water points with usage capacity limit 1000.\n\nUrban or Rural?, a community parameter that indicates the percentage of water points fall within ‘Urban’ or ‘Rural’ community.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisual Inferential Analysis\nHomepage > App > Visual Inferential Analysis\nThe key functions for this tab is to allow users to visually analyse variances (ANOVA) and correlation of various attributes across different states.\nFollowing are the key functions :\n\n\nANOVA\nThis tab allows users to visually analyse the variances by states based on the selected attribute.\nThere are 19 attributes available :\n\n3 options of water points options to select from “Total Waterpoints”, “Functional waterpoints” and “Non-functional Water Points”\n3 options of Technology parameter : “Handpumps”, “Mechanical Pumps” and “Tap Stands”.\n5 options of Capacity parameter : “Usage Capacity 50”, “Usage Capacity 250”, “Usage Capacity 300”, “Usage Capacity 1000” and “Usage Capacity below 1000”.\n2 options of Community parameter : “Urban” and “Rural” communities.\n2 options of Crucial Score parameter : “Low Crucial Score” and “High Crucial Score”.\n4 options of Pressure Score parameter : “Pressure Score below 0.9”, “above 0.9 but below 1.9”, “above 1.9, below 3.9” and “above 3.9”.\n\nCORRELATION\n\nThis tab allows users to visually explore the correlation strength between two attributes by select the attribute for Variable 1 and Variable 2.\n\n\n\n\nGeographical Segmentation\nHomepage > App > Geographical Segmentation\nThe key functions for this tab is to allow users to perform Hierarchical Clustering geospatial analysis based on 3 or more attributes.\nFollowing are the key functions :\n\nClustering Map\n\n\n\nDetermine Optimal K value\n\n\n\nVisual Analytics with Heatmap"
