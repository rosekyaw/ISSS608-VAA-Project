    "text": "In rural Africa, access to clean and safe water can be a challenge. Thousands of water points have been installed over the past decade, but they are of poor quality or are not well maintained, causing them to become non-functional. This can cause waterborne diseases, which can destroy lives and livelihoods. One country in West Africa which faces this issue in Nigeria.\nAccording to a research paper1 which utilises information from the 2015 Nigeria National Water and Sanitation Survey, more than 38 percent of all improved water points in Nigeria are non-functional. Hence, it would be in the interest of the Nigerian government, non-governmental organisations and researchers to discover water points patterns in Nigeria and potentially figure out what is causing the problem and how to solve it."

This will help reduce the difficulty of users such as the government, local community planners and academic researchers in visualising waterpoint patterns in Nigeria. The aim is to make the data more accessible and easier to interpret by having interactive charts showing both high-level patterns and low-level details, such as water access by the district."

It can display locations of functional, non-functional and unknown water points in terms of country-level or district-level throughout Nigeria. The intention is to help the users visualise which region in the country has higher functioning/non-functioning water points at a glance. There will be a few filtering options for the users, such as water points status, technology deployed in water points and performance of water points."

    "text": "User Guide\nThis Waterpoint app allows users to have an overview of the distribution of water points by operational status and attributes, analyse the water points visually and segment them into various clusters to facilitate decision-making in resources management for the water points.\nThis app has 3 key sections : Overview, Visual Inferential Analytics and Geographical Segmentation.\n\n\n\nOverview\nHomepage > App> Overview\nThe key functions of this section are to facilitate users to visualise the distribution of water points at LDA2 level. The percentage of the selected status measures their distribution within a given district.\n\n\n\nOverview for the distribution of functional waterpoints.\n\n\nThere are 3 types of statuses available :\n\nFunctional waterpoints.\nNon-functional waterpoints.\nUnknown waterpoints.\n\n\nThere are 6 key parameters available to supplement the overview of a selected status. When a parameter is selected, there will be more associated attributes available to choose. The attributes descriptions are listed below :\n\n\n\nDistribution of functional waterpoints with hand water pump deployed.\n\n\n\nWater source, refers to the 2 major types of water sources available for most of the water points in Nigeria. There are 2 options available :\n\nSpring\nWell\n\nTechnology, refers to the deployed equipment to supply water resources to the surrounding communities. There are 2 options available :\n\nHand Pump, shows the percentage of water points equipped with manual equipment.\nMechanical Pump, shows the percentage of water points with equipment that operated with minimal human involvement.\n\nPressure Score, measures the utilisation level of the water points. This is done by measuring the ratio of the population within 1 km radius of the water points and by the usage capacity limit thereof. There are 2 options available :\n\nAcceptable Pressure Score, are the water points that are not over-supporting the population within 1 km radius.\nHigh Pressure Score, are the water points that have breached their usage capacity limit. Urgent attention and resources are required to upgrade or maintain the water points to sustain the rural community’s growth.\n\nCrucial Score, measures the crucial level of the water points for the populations within 1 km radius. There are 2 options available :\n\nLow Crucial Score, are the water points with score below 0.4, generally supporting less than half of the population within 1 km radius.\nHigh Crucial Score, are the water points with score above 0.4, which may indicate they are supporting more than half of the population, with some of them supporting almost the entire population.\n\nCapacity, refers to the limit of the population water points can support. Generally, these limits are categorised into 5 main categories, namely 50, 250, 300, 500 and 1000. For this app, we group all the capacity categories below 1000 as 1 attribute to identify which area requires more resources to maintain or upgrade.\n\nLow Capacity, including all the usage capacity limits below 1000.\nHigh Capacity, refers are the water points with usage capacity limit 1000.\n\nCommunity, this parameter that indicates the percentage of water points falls within ‘Urban’ or ‘Rural’ community.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Inferential Analysis\nHomepage > App > Visual Inferential Analysis\nThe key functions of this section are to allow users to visually analyse variances (ANOVA) and correlations of various attributes across different states.\nThe following are the key functions :\n\n\n\nAnalyse variances of total waterpoints across all the states in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nVisually analyse variances\nThis tab allows users to visually analyse the variances by state based on the selected attribute.\nThere are 19 attributes available :\n\n3 options for water points options to select from “Total Waterpoints”, “Functional waterpoints” and “Non-functional Water Points”.\n3 options for Technology parameter : “Handpumps”, “Mechanical Pumps” and “Tap Stands”.\n5 options for Capacity parameter : “Usage Capacity 50”, “Usage Capacity 250”, “Usage Capacity 300”, “Usage Capacity 1000” and “Usage Capacity below 1000”.\n2 options for Community parameter : “Urban” and “Rural” communities.\n2 options for Crucial Score parameter : “Low Crucial Score” and “High Crucial Score”.\n4 options for Pressure Score parameter : “Pressure Score below 0.9”, “above 0.9 but below 1.9”, “above 1.9, below 3.9”, and “above 3.9”.\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis\n\n\n\n\nAvoid highly correlated variables that have a perfect straight line.\n\n\nThis tab, CORRELATION, allows users to visually explore the correlation strength between two attributes by selecting the attributes for Variable 1 and 2.\n\n\n\nGeographical Segmentation\nHomepage > App > Geographical Segmentation\nThe key functions of this section is to allow users to perform Hierarchical Clustering geospatial analysis based on selected attributes.\nThe following are the key functions :\n\nGeospatial Clustering Analysis\n\n\n\n\nThe Nigeria districts are segment into 3 clusters based on the selected 7 attributes and Hierarchical Clustering algorithm.\n\n\nThis tab, Cluster Map, displays the geographical segmentation based on the Hierarchical Clustering algorithm. The output will be based on minimum 3 selected attributes and the optimal default number of clusters, i.e. 3.\nUsers can glide the “Number of Cluster” to adjust the clustering output.\n\nFor app launching version :\n\nThe clustering analysis currently only supports 10 attributes. We will gradually release more attributes in subsequent app updates. Do reach out to us if you have any attributes in mind you would like to include in your geospatial analysis.\nThe number of clusters is limited to 10.\n\n\n\n\nDetermine Optimal K value\n\n\n\n\nElbow method\n\n\nThis tab, Optimal K, displays the chart to facilitate users in identifying the optimal default number of clusters, K, for the clustering analysis. There are 3 methods available, namely Elbow, Gap Statistics and Silhouette Score, to compare the K-values.\n\n\n\nSilhouette Score method\n\n\nNote : Subject to devices, it may take up to 40 seconds to render the output when changing the method option.\n\n\nVisual Analytics with Heatmap\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap for 7 Attributes\n\n\nThis tab, Heatmap, allows users to visually analyse the attributes’ performances across the identified segments, as shown by the dendrogram on the right."
